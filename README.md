**IMAGE CLASSIFICATION WITH CNN AND MLP USING MNIST AND FASHIONMNIST**

**Overview**

This project focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) models. We applied these models to MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets to classify handwritten digits and fashion items respectively.

The project covers the following key aspects :

1. Data Preprocessing and preparation
2. Model Architecture design using CNN and MLP
3. Training and Evaluation of models
4. Hyperparameter tuning and optimization
5. Comparision of accuracy and loss parametrics

**Datasets**

**MNIST** : Contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).
**Fashion MNIST** : Contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of fashion items ( 10 classes such as T-shirts, Trousers etc...)

**Models Used**

1. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** :
   * Deep Learning model designed for image data.
   * Uses Convolutional layers to detect patterns in images.
   * Well-suited for complex image data like Fashion MNIST.

2. **MLP (Multi-layer Perceptrons)** :
   * Fully connected feed-forward neural network.
   * Simpler architecture but effective for smaller image datasets like MNIST.
  
**Key Features**

* **Data Preprocessing** : Images are scaled and normalized for faster and more efficient model training.
* **Model Training** : Both models were trained using Adam optimizer, with cross-entropy loss for classification.
